# YelpAcademicData
This is done as part of my UCDavis SQL course cleaning and analyzing the Yelp Academic Database
Wowee was this more challenging than Coursera needed to make it. I ended up on a scavenger hunt for the data (grr) but found a not very clean version here https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yelp-dataset/yelp-dataset There is a good amount of cleaning that will go into prepping your columns. I ended up working with the 'user' database because it had a good number of metrics like number of years someone was elite, their ratings etc.

Okay....probably the most helpful thing you'll get out of here is that link. This data is JUST working in rstudio, so it's not all pretty like Tableau. Have a good day. Or really, any day you are feeling like having.
